"Hairless MIDI<->Serial Bridge" allows you to send MIDI messages
to/from a normal serial device (like an Arduino.)

This is version @VERSION@ of Hairless Midiserial.

The project home page is https://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/

For a tool which runs on the command line, I suggest checking out
ttymidi - http://www.varal.org/ttymidi/ - a different project that
creates a Serial/MIDI bridge on the command line. Hairless Midiserial is compatible with ttymidi.
