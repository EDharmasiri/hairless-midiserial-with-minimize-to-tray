RUNNING THE BRIDGE
==================

To run the MIDI<->Serial bridge, double-click the executable file.

If you're running under Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 10 then you may
need to right-click and Run As Administrator if you want to automatically reduce
the latency of FTDI-based serial devices. This is not required to use the other
features of Hairless Midiserial (although you may see a warning about failure to
reduce latency).
