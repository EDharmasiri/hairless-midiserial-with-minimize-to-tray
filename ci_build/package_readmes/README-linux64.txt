RUNNING THE BRIDGE
==================

Run "hairless-midiserial" in this directory.

The executable is static linked, so you don't need to have installed Qt. The binary is built for 32-bit (i686) Linux. The only required libraries are X11 libraries and the ALSA library "asound". This package is often called "libasound2" and is already installed on most default desktop Linux systems.
